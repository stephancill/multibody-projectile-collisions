# multibody-projectile-collisions
Senior Research Project by Stephan Cilliers and Emile Tredoux (2017)

# Usage
Add projectiles to the scene and press "Start" to begin the simulation.

## Presets
Presets are predefined combinations of projectile setups created by us. To load a preset do the following:
1. Select the Preset from the dropdown menu.
2. Press the "Load Preset" button.
3.1 Press the "Start" button to simulate.
3.2 Press the "Reset" button to reset the simulation.

## Adding projectiles
There are two ways of adding projectiles to the scene.
### The "Add Projectile" form
1. Edit the properies of the projectile that you would like to change.
2. Press "Add".

### Using the mouse
1. Edit the properties of the projectile that you would like it to posess.
2. Click the "Select position" button.
3. Click at the location that you would like to place the projectile on the scene.
4. Click again to determine the direction and magnitude of its force.

## Comparing projectiles
It is possible to compare two projectiles and view information about the projectiles relative to each other. 
Such as whether they will collide next (if so, at what position and when) and the distance between them.
1. Select the IDs of 2 projectiles.
